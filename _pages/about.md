## Welcome to lucky-sugar-park

👋 Hi, my name is In Soo Park.  
👥 I have much experience about software archiecting and developing while doing many activities and projects.  
👀 I’m interested in Software Design and Development with highest quality.  
🤖 I would like to develop best quality software with fantastic architecture.  
💻 I’m good at various computer language including java, javascript, typescript, c, c++, c#, python and I'm also really good at frontend, backend and networking programming including react, springframework, netty and so on.  
📝 I’m aiming to share my code reimplementing thesis by myself and project that uses it.  
📈 and, I'd like to contributes for open source community in the future with my talanted in specially software architecture.  


I have other two git account as belows  
  - [My first git account](https://www.github.com/insoo67park)
  - [My second git acccount](https://github.com/wondermelon4ever)

I have certificates related to software development, architecture, cloud.  
You can find it at **[Linkinin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/insoo-park)**  

I'm very interested in solving software problem using software algorithm and I have a badge   
[![Solved.ac Profile](http://mazassumnida.wtf/api/v2/generate_badge?boj=ispark)](https://solved.ac/ispark/)  

I love to design and develop architecture (techinical, software or infrastructure). 
- I have worked at Samsung SDS as a Chief architecture (TA+DA+SA) for a long time.  
- I mainly consult in design cloud related architecture including MSA issues.

I also love to develop software (application) in many kind of criteria (from backend to frontend)  
Its always give me pleasure.  
- I also have very excellent software design skill using design patterns  

I can handle many programming languages including java, javascript, c, c++, c++, python as with several decade experiences.  
I think, it is not important which language is used. The really important thing is how we can succesfully design software in required functional/non functional requirement with saving each programming language's characteristices.  

Each programming language has it's philosophy and it should be considered when we design and develop software.  
I would like to post about programming languages in near furure (step by step)  

I can handle frontend and backend technologies as belows  
- React framework (High level), Vue (Mid level)  
  - I love to adopt frontend's design pattern when design frontend application.  
- Springframework/Springboot, Hibernetes, Mybatis, Netty ... (High Level),   
- FastAPI, Uvicorn (Mid level)
- Kubernetes (Mid+ Level), Kubeflow (Mid Level)  
- GCP, AWS (Low+ Level)

You can see my detailed project histories at **[Linkinin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/insoo-park)**    
I would like to post and share my concerns, my experience in here including algorithm, IT technology, my project and my code   

You can find my resume at **[here](../files/resume.docx)**
